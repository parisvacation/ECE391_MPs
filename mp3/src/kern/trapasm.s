#
# That is, copy the text below, place your cursor at .global _mmode_trap_entry and select until the end of file,
# and paste.
#
# You must redefine _mmode_trap_entry to have a new definition.
#
# Or, another way of saying it is that we are replacing the old mmode trap entry (which originally just panicked)
# to provide some key functionality in addition to the normal panic function. The purpose and motivation for this
# is discussed in the comments below.

# RISC-V does not provide a built-in S mode timer, only an M mode timer. The
# rationale is that the M mode environment will provide a virtualized timer to S
# mode guests. That's fancy and modern, but we're trying to create a "bare
# metal" OS. So the solution we have here is this:
#
#   1. S mode has full RW access to the memory-mapped timer registers.
#   2. When S mode wants to enable timer interrupts, in addition to setting the
#      STIE bit, it also executes an ecall instruction, which we handle here,
#      setting MTIE and clearing STIP.
#   3. When a M mode timer interrupt occurs, we set STIP and clear MTIE. S mode
#      then needs to re-arm timer interrupts using (2).
